  In this article, you'll learn the most easiest ways to implement Adding, Updating and Deleting contacts in a Flutter app.
  And we'll do it using the <a href="https://pub.dev/packages/contacts_service" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ContactsService</a> Flutter package.
  So hold your horses, and hang tight!

## Prerequisites
In order to follow this article, you need to be familiar with [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/). I.e. should have the basic understanding of how
Flutter works. You should also have the tooling set up for developing for either Android or iOS. See the [Get started](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) section on the official docs.


## Let the game begin

First of all, you have to clone the GitHub repository for the project.
So open your terminal/command prompt and run the following command

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AhsanAyaz/flutter_contacts_list.git
```

Now, checkout the `feat/add-delete-contacts-start` branch by running the following command:

```bash
git checkout feat/add-delete-contacts-start
```

Great! Open the project in your favorite editor now. [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) has been my choice for a while now.
