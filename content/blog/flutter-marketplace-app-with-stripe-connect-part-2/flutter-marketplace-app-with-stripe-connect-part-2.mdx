  In this article, you'll learn how to configure Payments using Stripe Connect
  for a marketplace app built with Flutter. I'll also be working on a hands-on
  video tutorial as well. This is for those of you who love reading and
  following articles more. Following are the links to the code for the flutter
  app and the stripe backend:&nbsp;

### Implementing Deep Links in the Flutter app

To be able to get back from the Browser (Connect Onboarding Flow) to the Flutter
app, we need to implement Flutter Deep Links. You can read more about them on
the Flutter Deeplinking docs. To keep this tutorial short, we're going to
implement Custom URL Scheme for our Flutter app. This scheme is the same scheme
we tend to navigate to when clicking the **Continue to App** button on the
Connect Onboarding redirect page. As shown in Figure 1.12.

Open the file `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and update it as
follows:

```dart{8,22-28}
<manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    package="com.example.flutter_stripe_connect">
    <queries>
        ...
    </queries>
   <application
        android:label="flutter_stripe_connect"
        android:usesCleartextTraffic="true"
        android:icon="@mipmap/ic_launcher">
        <activity
            android:name=".MainActivity"
            android:launchMode="singleTop"
            android:theme="@style/LaunchTheme"
            android:configChanges="orientation|keyboardHidden|keyboard|screenSize|smallestScreenSize|locale|layoutDirection|fontScale|screenLayout|density|uiMode"
            android:hardwareAccelerated="true"
            android:windowSoftInputMode="adjustResize">
            ...
            <intent-filter>
                <action android:name="android.intent.action.MAIN"/>
                <category android:name="android.intent.category.LAUNCHER"/>
            </intent-filter>
            <meta-data android:name="flutter_deeplinking_enabled" android:value="true" />
            <intent-filter>
                <action android:name="android.intent.action.VIEW" />
                <category android:name="android.intent.category.DEFAULT" />
                <category android:name="android.intent.category.BROWSABLE" />
                <data android:scheme="pandagums" />
            </intent-filter>
        </activity>
        ...
    </application>
</manifest>
```

> Note: After the above change, the app needs a full restart. Restart the app
> before proceeding with further steps.
