Writing books is fun, perhaps. I wouldn't know because I haven't done it ¯\_(ツ)_/¯. lol. Even writing articles is something I really like. But creating video courses? OMG! In this article I'm going to share why it took me two years to write an ionic video course.

It was May 28, 2018 when a Video Acquisition Editor from Packt reached out to me. He asked me if I was interested in creating an Ionic video course. As always, I was pretty happy to do something new.

## Conclusion
Angular provides a lot of things out of the box and we can build our own stuff on top of those things. This was just one example. I'd really love to know what you build after reading this article. You might extend any services or pipes to create your own :)
